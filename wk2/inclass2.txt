Download the files: inclass_skel.sv, logic_blk.sv, ram.sv and counter.sv from
http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~traylor/ece474/inclass/wk2

Using the given block diagram and the module description for logic_blk, ram and
counter, fill out and complete the skeleton code in inclass_skel.sv.

When you are done, write a script that compiles all the files bottom up and
remove any errors.  Of course you must create a work directory first with:
"vlib work".

Once you have done this create a makefile to mantain your files.  This is done
with the tool vmake.  Vmake works only on a compiled work directory.  Thus you
must compile all the files in your design once before you execute vmake.  

Vmake is run by typing:  vmake > makefile

The file makefile is used by the Linux make utility to recreate a design by 
recompiling only those files that need it when edits are made.

After you have made the makefile, typing "touch ram.sv" will update the
timestamp of ram.sv.  Typing make after that will cause make to recompile
the design again to incorporate the (faked out) change.
